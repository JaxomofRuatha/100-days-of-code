# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting Portfolio to use updated build process and packages, reorganized file structure.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately most of the evening ended up being spent on trying to fix the development environment with my Ubuntu VMWare machine and dealing with a VS Code issue crashing my attempts at progress with npm. Successfully got Pug and Sass working with npm scripts though!

### Day 0.1: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finalized initial Portfolio development environment and some tweaks, revisited Weather build.

**Thoughts:** I changed over from a Gulp build process using multiple server instances for development to a single one using BrowserSync and npm scripts, in addition to separating out the scripts for production build. Had some issues with Chrome/Firefox displaying UI differently, unable to fix initially but consistent scaling needs to be addressed in several applications. I went back to the Local Weather application and updated the packages and a few scripts.

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Modified landing page and autocomplete UI for Local Weather application

**Thoughts:** Having some issues with the autocomplete form's styling, but the functionality is restored and I was able to get a better feel for how the third party React component is set up.
