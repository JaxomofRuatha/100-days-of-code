# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting Portfolio to use updated build process and packages, reorganized file structure.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately most of the evening ended up being spent on trying to fix the development environment with my Ubuntu VMWare machine and dealing with a VS Code issue crashing my attempts at progress with npm. Successfully got Pug and Sass working with npm scripts though!

### Day 0.1: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finalized initial Portfolio development environment and some tweaks, revisited Weather build.

**Thoughts:** I changed over from a Gulp build process using multiple server instances for development to a single one using BrowserSync and npm scripts, in addition to separating out the scripts for production build. Had some issues with Chrome/Firefox displaying UI differently, unable to fix initially but consistent scaling needs to be addressed in several applications. I went back to the Local Weather application and updated the packages and a few scripts.

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Modified landing page and autocomplete UI for Local Weather application

**Thoughts:** Having some issues with the autocomplete form's styling, but the functionality is restored and I was able to get a better feel for how the third party React component is set up.

### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Committed the shell for React/Redux opinionated boilerplate, played around with sandbox settings, touched up Weather a bit more.

**Thoughts:** Today was my last day at my job due to contract termination, so...actually happy with how much I got done, even if most of it wasn't coding. I've been meaning to get some personal templates/starters set up for a while, especially for experimentation, so this is a good step in that direction!

### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked out a pretty significant portion of how I want to have my boilerplate set up, including file structure

**Thoughts:** I'm going to be setting things up from the starter to use in my Recipe Book application (which will end up being a more full-fledged health app eventually). For now things are placeholders, but I am creating a layout for what I want to be the baseline starter kit elements versus the more specific portions (Sequelize vs Mongoose vs No ORM MongoDb/MySQL/PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on the edx course for Simple Data today (using Racket) along with continuing to tweak development environments.

**Thoughts:** I'm debating whether I want to stick with using WSL, and/or trying to determine whether there's an effective way to get GUI programs to launch correctly from the WSL Bash/Fish prompt. I have Docker working in Toolbox at least, but I haven't tried integrating it with the normal commands within the Bash terminal. I may end up giving up on convenience and dual-booting Linux rather than trying to emulate it...
