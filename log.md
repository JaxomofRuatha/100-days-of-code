# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting Portfolio to use updated build process and packages, reorganized file structure.

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately most of the evening ended up being spent on trying to fix the development environment with my Ubuntu VMWare machine and dealing with a VS Code issue crashing my attempts at progress with npm. Successfully got Pug and Sass working with npm scripts though!
